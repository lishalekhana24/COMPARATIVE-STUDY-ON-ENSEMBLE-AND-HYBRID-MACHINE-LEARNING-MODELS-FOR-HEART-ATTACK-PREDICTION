# COMPARATIVE-STUDY-ON-ENSEMBLE-AND-HYBRID-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODELS-FOR-HEART-ATTACK-PREDICTION
Prediction of heart diseases is considered a major tool in the prevention and treatment at an early stage, and it will have a prospect of saving millions of lives each year. The paper draws several kinds of machine learning models with a focus on hybrid models and ensemble techniques for precise prediction. Among the hybrid methods are taken LR-Bagging, OHE2LM, and DT-SVM, where all are ensemble methods. Another method applied here is Stacking, Boosting, Bagging, and Voting.
The results indicate that hybrid models like LR-Bagging and OHE2LM, though they achieve very high testing accuracies at 88.52%, have the ensemble models, particularly the Voting classifier, which can achieve up to 90% accuracy in both training and testing phases. This analysis will depict the great potential of having a variety of algorithms combined to improve the predictability of heart diseases with the help of more efficient hybrid and ensemble models in healthcare.
